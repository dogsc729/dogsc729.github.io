M.S. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Michigan

Before joining UMich, I received the degree of Bachelor of Science in [Electrical Engineering](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html)(NTU) in January 2023. At NTU, I am fortunate to conduct undergraduate research about **Federated Learning on Person Re-ID** under supervision of [Prof. Shao-Yi Chien](http://www.ee.ntu.edu.tw/bio1.php?id=101). 

In the past, I worked for [MIH Open EV Alliance](https://www.mih-ev.org/en/index/) as a **Software Engineer Intern.** Prior to joining MIH, I was a **Data Center Intern** at [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) and **FAE Intern** at [Arrow Electronics](https://www.arrow.com/).
